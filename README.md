# VCFParser
This project is a VCFv4.2 Python parser developed for the exam of the course "Bioinformatics".
>Project's specifications are taken from [samtools](https://github.com/samtools/hts-specs) version 4.2.

A vcf file is used to specifies the format of a text file used in bioinformatics for storing gene sequence variations.
This parser checks if the file is well-formed and respect the requirements of version 4.2.
